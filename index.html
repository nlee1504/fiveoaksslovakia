  <p class="verse">‚ÄúDo everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, ‚Äúchildren of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.‚Äù Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Philippians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠2‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠14-16</p>

The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me." May our work as a team combined with the Slovakian believers be a witness</p>

  <p class="verse">Since, I‚Äôve been studying and writing for CG on the book of Ruth. I have been thinking a lot about the Providence of God.

I am so eager to see what and how God is going work and provide for the team and how it will work for and to His Church.</p>

  <p class="verse">This is tough. There are a lot of things here. I keep thinking of the Great Commission in Matthew 28. I just want to do the Lord‚Äôs Will and make disciples of all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I would love to have people come to know Jesus through this trip. I do desire to come to know God more through this trip. So it‚Äôs hard for me to single out one piece of God‚Äôs character. I just desire to be in greater intimacy, fellowship, intentionality, relationship with Him during and after this mission trip. And gain direction and understanding of the specific mission God has created me for as well.</p>

  <p class="verse">I am focusing on the power of God this trip. It has been something I have been meditating on for a while. He has the power to transform hearts, he has the power to work through us, he has the power to do miracles. And I just am praying that I would, with fear and trembling, be able to participate with the Lord in his miracles this trip! The verse I am focusing on is Job 42:2 with his response to God asking him who can do all of these amazing things. Job's reply is "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted"</p>
