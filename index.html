    <p><strong>Worship Songs:</strong> Amazing Grace (Chris Tomlin), Goodness of God (Jenn Johnson), Old Rugged Cross (Alan Jackson)</p>
    <p class="verse">“Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.” ‭‭Philippians‬ ‭2‬:‭14-16</p>

    <h2>Kyler Albert</h2>
    <p><strong>Worship Songs:</strong> Doxology//Amen, By His Wounds, Nobody</p>
    <p class="verse">Since I’ve been studying and writing for CG on the book of Ruth, I have been thinking a lot about the Providence of God. This trip has been a Providential plan of His for us as a family—and now beyond. I am so eager to see what and how God is going to work and provide for the team and how it will work for and to His Church.</p>

    <h2>Noah Larson</h2>
    <p><strong>Worship Songs:</strong> How Many Times (Newsboys), My God Is Still the Same (Sanctus Real), My Promised Land (Josiah Queen)</p>
    <p class="verse">Being open about my faith and intentionally steering the conversation towards God. I want to do more than just smile and be joyful to show them God's love. I want to bring it into conversations.</p>

    <h2>Michael Wesner</h2>
    <p><strong>Worship Songs:</strong> Psalm 46 (Lord of Hosts) – Shane & Shane, Awesome God (Live) – Michael W. Smith, He Will Hold Me Fast (Live) – Sovereign Grace Music</p>
    <p class="verse">This is tough. There are a lot of things here. I keep thinking of the Great Commission in Matthew 28. I just want to do the Lord’s Will and make disciples of all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I would love to have people come to know Jesus through this trip. I do desire to come to know God more through this trip. So it’s hard for me to single out one piece of God’s character. I just desire to be in greater intimacy, fellowship, intentionality, relationship with Him during and after this mission trip. And gain direction and understanding of the specific mission God has created me for as well.</p>

    <p class="verse">This might sound cliché, but “let go, let God.” Just reminding myself that the Lord has a plan and things may happen that I don’t understand, but God has a plan. Proverbs 3:5-6 has been one of my biggest “life lines.” It’s a great reminder to give myself grace but also to put my plans/goals aside and open my heart for what God has in store—not just for me but for these students we’re going to work with.</p>
    <p class="fun-fact">Fun Fact: I love to collect agates (type of rock)</p>
